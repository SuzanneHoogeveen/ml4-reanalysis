# A Bayesian Many-Analysis Of Many Labs 4

Many Labs 4 is a large scale attempt to replicate a key finding from the mortality salience literature, and to assess the impact on replicability if the original authors of a study are involved. After data collection from over 2,000 participants in 21 labs with and without involvement of the original authors the project could not replicate the original finding of Study 1 of Greenberg et al., 1994. We decided to run a Bayesian reanalysis of the data using a many-analyses scheme similar to a multiverse analysis where several analysis settings, inclusing priors and exclusion criteria, are varied.
